# Workshop 3DSlicer - SOFA
*This GitHub repository complements the [workshop 3D Slicer - SOFA](https://igt.uc3m.es/2025/05/27/new-workshop-on-3d-slicer-and-sofa/) organized at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid by [the IGT group](https://igt.uc3m.es/).*

The workshop is focused on **3D Slicer and the SOFA framework**, two powerful open-source tools widely used in digital health and biomedical research.

This course is aimed at **undergraduate and master’s students, as well as early-career researchers** interested in learning how to perform anatomical segmentation, soft tissue simulation, and biomechanical modeling.

No prior experience is required — we’ll start from the basics and build up through practical, hands-on sessions.
