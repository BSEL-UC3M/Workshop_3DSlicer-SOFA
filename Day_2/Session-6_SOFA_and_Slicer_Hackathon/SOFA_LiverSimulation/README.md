# 🧪 Hackathon Solution – Soft Tissue Simulation

## 📁 Solution folder

The folder `_Solution_` contains the complete solution to the hackathon challenge. Inside this folder, you will find the following files:

- `hackathon_softissue_solution.py`:  
  This script contains the full implementation of the solution.  
  Feel free to read through the code to understand the entire process step by step.

- `boundary.mrk.json` and `hackathon_liver_tetra.vtk`:  
  These files contain the **simulation data** required to run the script.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

The script is configured to look for the simulation data in the `/tmp` directory.

To run the solution successfully, you must either:

1. **Move the data files into the `/tmp` folder**,  
**or**  
2. **Edit the script** and update the file paths to match the actual location of your data.

## 📌 Note

This solution is intended for educational and demonstration purposes as part of the 3D Slicer–SOFA Workshop.  
We encourage you to explore and modify it to suit your own simulation needs.

## 📁 Additional Files

The following files are also included in this directory, although they are **not required** to run the solution provided in the `_Solution_` folder:

- `LiverGrid_simulation.scn`  
- `LiverGrid_simulation.scn.view`  
- `LiverMesh_simulation.scn.scn`  
- `LiverMesh_simulation.scn.scn.view`  
- `MESHES_VTK.zip`  
- `liver_09.jpg`  
- `mesh/` (folder)

These files may contain **additional simulations, mesh data**, or **visual resources** related to liver modeling.  
They are provided **for reference or further exploration** and may be useful for users who want to extend or adapt the project.

Feel free to explore these resources as needed.
